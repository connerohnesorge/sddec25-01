  This research optimizes semantic segmentation algorithms for
  real-time eye tracking in medical assistive
  technology~\cite{garcia2017review,ronneberger2015}. We implement
  efficient sequential DPU scheduling on the AMD Kria KV260 platform,
  addressing the constraint that the Deep Processing Unit (DPU) can
  only execute one inference at a time. 

  This optimization is critical for medical
  assistance devices serving individuals with mobility impairments,
  enabling faster detection and response to medical emergencies while
  preserving user safety and autonomy.
